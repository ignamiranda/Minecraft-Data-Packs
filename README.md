# Minecraft-Data-Packs

## Datapack Ideas:
### Multiplayer Mob Health Scaling

Upon spawning, mobs' health is multiplied by the number of players. With configurable min and max multiplier.

### Mo' Jockeys

Mobs that can spawn riding all sorts of animals

Overworld:
* Creepers writing angry bees
* Skeletons riding wolves
* Drowned riding dolphins (not currently possible)
* Zombies/Husks riding Zombie Horse
* Zombies/Skeletons riding Slimes
* Baby zombies riding silverfish
* Baby zombies riding creepers/zombies/skeletons

Nether:
* Skeletons/Crossbow Piglins riding Striders in Lava
* Skeletons/Wither Skeletons riding Magma Cubes
* Zombie Piglin riding a Zoglin

### Solstice

Every X days, there is a day where the sun doesn't come up

### Impossible Loot

Find rare loot that has enchantments that are higher level than possible in the vanilla game.

### Skylands

A custom dimension that you get to by flying over a certain height. If you fall off, you'll go back into the overworld, just below the configured height. If you're not wearing an Elytra, you might have to prepare a landing point (like having water at the right coordinates). Flying above the Skylands takes you into The End, as if you're going into space.

### Player Zombification

If a player is killed by a zombie, they turn into a zombie that has their face and is wearing all their stuff.

### Vanilla Infernal Mobs
