# Minecraft-Data-Packs

## Datapack Ideas:
* Multiplayer Mob Health Scaling - Upon spawning, mobs' health is multiplied by the number of players. With configurable min and max multiplier.
* Mo' Jockeys - Mobs that can spawn riding all sorts of animals
* Solstice - Every X days, there is a day that is fully nighttime
* Impossible Loot - Find rare loot that has enchantments that are higher level than possible in the vanilla game.
* Skylands - A custom dimension that you get to by flying over a certain height. If you fall off, you'll go back into the overworld, just below the configured height. Flying above the Skylands takes you into The End.
